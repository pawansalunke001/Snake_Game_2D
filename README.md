# Snake_Game_2D.
• Snake Game: Snake is an older classic video game. It was first created in late 70s. Later it was brought to PCs. This game is sometimes called Nibbles.

# About project: 
In this game the player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a
bordered plane, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time
the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
